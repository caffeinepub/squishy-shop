  "summary": "The diff implements all four requirements (REQ-12 through REQ-15) for adding seller functionality to the Dino Squad e-commerce platform. The implementation includes a Sell button in the navigation header, a new SellPage component with a complete form for product submission, backend endpoints to handle seller submissions with approval status, and integration using React Query mutations. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the evidence in the diff.",
