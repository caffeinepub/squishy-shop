# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add seller functionality allowing users to list items for sale on the marketplace.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a "Sell" button to the main navigation header
- Create a new Sell page with a form for listing products (name, description, price, category, image upload)
- Implement backend storage for product submissions with pending approval status
- Connect the Sell page form to the backend to submit new listings

**User-visible outcome:** Users can click a "Sell" button in the header, fill out a form to list their own Paper Squishies or Slime products, and submit them for approval to be sold on the marketplace.
